## Description
Thanks to JavaScript Mastery on Youtube, I built my first website using the React framework. This is an important project for me because React is one of the most important tools for building intent pages :blue_heart:
###
My site is mainly focused on frontend. This means that there is no greater functionality than just its appearance :heart_eyes:
